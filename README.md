## Mini-Diffuse-Actor

Achieves 92% of the performance of [3D-Diffuser-Actor](https://github.com/nickgkan/3d_diffuser_actor) on the RLBench-18 multi-task benchmark, with just 1 day of training on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

This code space builds upon [3D-LUTOS](https://github.com/vlc-robot/robot-3dlotus/) â€” many thanks to the original authors for open-sourcing their container and providing a robust headless training-evaluation-testing pipeline.

ðŸš§ Project in progress â€” updates coming soon!
